# 1 - Ad-hoc commands

For our first exercise, we are going to run some ad-hoc commands to help you get a feel for how Ansible works. Ansible ad-hoc commands enable you to perform tasks on remote nodes without having to write a playbook. They are very useful when you simply need to do one or two things quickly, to many remote nodes.

Ad-hoc commands can be run on the command line and with the Ansible Automation Platform.
We will try both ways and switch between running ad-hoc commands on the CLI and in the AAP.

## Preparation

Ensure that you are in your project folder and that you can run the Ansible CLI utility, run the following command:

```bash
git status
```

```bash
ansible --version
```

The output looks something like this:

``` { .bash .no-copy }
[student@ansible-1 workshop_project]$ ansible --version
ansible [core 2.14.0]
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = ['/home/student/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/ansible
  ansible collection location = /home/student/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.9.13 (main, Nov  9 2022, 13:16:24) [GCC 8.5.0 20210514 (Red Hat 8.5.0-15)] (/usr/bin/python3.9)
  jinja version = 3.1.2
  libyaml = True
```

The output gives some useful informations, the most important one are these:

* `config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` - The currently used configuration file for Ansible
* `python version = 3.9.13` - The Python interpreter used on the Controller (there may be multiple Python version installed...)

Let's take a look at the current Ansible configuration, you can use the `cat` command to output the file contents to stdout.

``` { .bash .no-copy }
[student@ansible-1 workshop_project]$ cat /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg 
[defaults]
stdout_callback = yaml
connection = smart
timeout = 60
deprecation_warnings = False
action_warnings = False
system_warnings = False
devel_warning = False
host_key_checking = False
collections_on_ansible_version_mismatch = ignore
retry_files_enabled = False
interpreter_python = auto_silent
inventory = /home/student/lab_inventory/hosts
[persistent_connection]
connect_timeout = 200
command_timeout = 200
```

## Step 1 - Test connection

### Step 1.1 - On CLI

Ansible needs to know which hosts are targeted for the automation, therefor all Ansible content development starts with defining a *inventory* and sorting your hosts into *groups* in it. For most use cases, a inventory in the `.ini` format is the easiest to work with. Let's create a simple inventory with a single group called `windows` and put your test host in it. Create a file `hosts` (you can left out the file extenstion, by default, Ansible asumes that the file is formated in the *ini* format).

```bash
touch
```

```ini
[windows]

```

The inventory file is in `.ini` format, this is one of the possible formats the inventory can be provided. Ansible itself parses the inventory and uses a JSON representation, let's take a look on how Ansible sees our inventory:

```bash
ansible-inventory --list
```

The command above outputs info about **all** hosts in the inventory, the groups in which every host is in and which variables (mostly connection variables) are defined for every host. The `ansible-inventory` utility has more functionality, use the `--help` parameter.

All right, we have an inventory, let's test if we can reach our target node in the *windows* group. We will use the `ansible` utility to execute an *ad-hoc* command and will provide the `ansible.windows.win_ping` module. The `win_ping` module makes sure our windows hosts are responsive. This is not a traditional (ICMP) *ping*, but actually verifying both connectivity and authentication to the host.

Execute the following command:

```bash
ansible windows -m ansible.windows.win_ping
```

The ad-hoc command expects a group to target (here it is the *windows* group) and a module with optional arguments.

??? info "Which inventory is used?"

    If the `inventory` parameter is not set in the `ansible.cfg` file, you need to provide the path to your inventory file with the `-i` (`--inventory`) parameter when executing the command.

    ```bash
    ansible -i /home/student/lab_inventory/hosts windows -m win_ping
    ```

    You can use the relative path as well.

!!! failure
    Well, this didn't went well, we encountered an error.

    ```bash
    student1-win1 | FAILED! => {
        "msg": "The module win_ping was redirected to ansible.windows.win_ping, which could not be loaded."
    }
    ```

The module was not found, let's see which collections are installed (this is the place where modules are stored).

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection list
```

Another error, this one states that no collections (except the builtin collection *ansible.builtin*) are installed, let's install the missing collection:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.windows
```

Ok, looks good, try the ad-hoc command again.

!!! failure
    Another error?

    ```bash
    student1-win1 | FAILED! => {
        "msg": "winrm or requests is not installed: No module named 'winrm'"
    }
    ```

A missing dependency, Ansible modules are (mostly) written in Python (or in Powershell for Windows), they sometimes need additional Python modules or libraries. Let's install the missing depedency:

```bash
pip3.9 install pywinrm --user
```

We installed the `pywinrm` Python module with the Python package manager for the Python version Ansible is running with, this is needed for the initial connection from the Ansible Controller to the target host.  
Let's install another missing dependency:

```bash
pip3.9 install requests-credssp --user
```

This module is needed because of the configured WinRM transport method. If we would have run the ad-hoc command, the error message would have stated the missing package.

Ok, one more try, run the ad-hoc command again.

```bash
[student@ansible-1 workshop_project]$ ansible windows -m win_ping
student1-win1 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

!!! success
    Finally, everything in place! We can connect **and** authenticate with our Windows target node.

### Step 1.2 - In AAP

After running the *ad-hoc* command on the command line, let's do it in the Automation Platform.

As before, we will need to go to our Inventory. So click **Inventories** on the left panel, and then click the name of our Inventory **Workshop Inventory**. Now that you are on the Inventory Details page, we will need to go select our Host. So click **HOSTS**.

Next to each host is a checkbox. Check the box next to each host you want to run an ad-hoc Command on. Select the **Run Command** button.

![Run Command](images/2-adhoc-run-command.png)

This will pop up the **Execute Command** window. From here is where we can run a single task against our hosts.

Letâ€™s start with something really basic - pinging a host.

Fill out this form as follows

| Key                   | Value                                  | Note                                                           |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Module                | `win_ping`                             |                                                                |
| Arguments             |                                        | Intentionally blank                                            |
| Limit                 |                                        | This should display the host you selected in the previous step |

Click the **Next** button

| Key                   | Value                                  | Note |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Execution environment | windows workshop execution environment |      |

Click the **Next** button

| Key                | Value               | Note |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ---- |
| Machine credential | Workshop Credential |      |

Once you click **LAUNCH** you will be redirected to the Job log. Every job and action in Automation Controller is recorded and stored. These logs can also be exported automatically to another logging system such as Splunk or ELK.

The output tab is shown by default. Any output generated by the task is displayed here.

![Win\_Ping output](images/2-adhoc-run-win_ping-output.png)

The details tab shows information on when the task was executed, by whom, with what credential and what hosts were affected.

![Win\_Ping details](images/2-adhoc-run-win_ping-details.png)

The results returned will be different depending on which module is used, as they all handle and deal with different data sets depending on the task. No matter which module is used, you will always see a color coded STATUS of either SUCCESS, FAILURE, CHANGED, or SKIPPING.

## Step 2 - Get infos about target

Ad-hoc commands are perfect to gather informations about your target system.

### Step 2.1 - On CLI

We will now take a look at your Windows node configuration. The `setup` module queries the remote host for various data and returns that data as Ansible facts. This data is useful to determine things such as operating system version, hardware configuration, among other data points. This can then be used in your playbook for all sorts of reasons such as determining whether a task should even run, or determining what the name of a package should be based upon the operating system version.

The `setup` module will run automatically at the beginning of every playbook, unless configured not to, so that this data is always available to your playbook.

Run the following command:

```bash
ansible windows -m ansible.windows.setup
```

You are seeing loads of useful informations and you can use every bit as variables in your playbooks later on!

### Step 2.2 - In AAP

After running the *ad-hoc* command to gather infos on the command line, let's do it again in the Automation Platform.

You need to go back to *Inventories* :material-arrow-right: *Workshop Inventory* :material-arrow-right: *Hosts* :material-arrow-right: Activate Checkbox of Windows host :material-arrow-right: Click *Run command*.  
Lets go ahead and run the `setup` module to look at the output. Fill out the **EXECUTE COMMAND** form again with this info.

| Key       | Value   | Note                                                           |
| --------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Module    | `setup` |                                                                |
| Arguments |         | Intentionally blank                                            |
| Limit     |         | This should display the host you selected in the previous step |

Click the **Next** button

| Key                   | Value                                  | Note |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Execution environment | windows workshop execution environment |      |

Click the **Next** button

| Key                | Value               | Note |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ---- |
| Machine credential | Workshop Credential |      |

You should see output like this:

![Setup Log Details](images/2-adhoc-run-setup-output.png)

(**Note:** If you click the three dots shown on line 21 in the above output, you will see all the facts returned by the `setup` module.)

## Step 3 - Run PS command

Now letâ€™s see how we can run a PowerShell command and view the output using the `win_shell` module.

### Step 3.1 - On CLI

You are getting more and more familiar with ad-hoc commands, now you need to provide additional arguments to the used Ansible module.  

Run the following command to run the `Get-Service` Powershell command:

```bash
ansible windows -m ansible.windows.win_shell -a "Get-Service"
```

The output looks something like this:

```bash
student@ansible-1 workshop_project]$ ansible windows -m ansible.windows.win_shell -a "Get-Service"
student1-win1 | CHANGED | rc=0 >>

Status   Name               DisplayName                           
------   ----               -----------                           
Running  AmazonSSMAgent     Amazon SSM Agent                      
Stopped  AppIDSvc           Application Identity                  
Stopped  AppMgmt            Application Management                
Stopped  AppReadiness       App Readiness                         
Stopped  AppXSvc            AppX Deployment Service (AppXSVC)     
Stopped  AWSLiteAgent       AWS Lite Guest Agent                  
Running  BFE                Base Filtering Engine                 
Stopped  BITS               Background Intelligent Transfer Ser...
Running  CertPropSvc        Certificate Propagation

Stopped  ClipSVC            Client License Service (ClipSVC)
...
```

The output is not green anymore as before, but yellow, the output also states that something was *CHANGED*.  
We do know that nothing changed, but for Ansible any command could be provided through Powershell, it can't predict what will happen or if the desired state is already reached. This is called *idempotency* and the `win_shell` (and `win_command`) module do not support this. All other Windows modules work idempotent, try to use these instead of `win_shell` or `win_command`.

### Step 3.2 - In AAP

You know the drill, go to the spot to run *ad-hoc* commands against the Windows target node.

Letâ€™s fill out the form again, but this time use the `win_shell` module to execute the `Get-Service` Powershell command.

| Key       | Value         | Note                                                           |
| --------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Module    | `win_shell`   |                                                                |
| Arguments | `Get-Service` |                                                                |
| Limit     |               | This should display the host you selected in the previous step |

Click the **Next** button

| Key                   | Value                                  | Note |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Execution environment | windows workshop execution environment |      |

Click the **Next** button

| Key                | Value               | Note |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ---- |
| Machine credential | Workshop Credential |      |

Launch the job and view the results. You will see that it returns a direct output of what the Powershell command returned. This data can be stored to a variable and directly parsed inside your Ansible playbook later on.

And run it one more time with the `Get-Process` Powershell command.

| Key       | Value         | Note                                                           |
| --------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Module    | `win_shell`   |                                                                |
| Arguments | `Get-Process` |                                                                |
| Limit     |               | This should display the host you selected in the previous step |

Click the **Next** button

| Key                   | Value                                  | Note |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Execution environment | windows workshop execution environment |      |

Click the **Next** button

| Key                | Value               | Note |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ---- |
| Machine credential | Workshop Credential |      |

The difference between `ansible.windows.win_shell` and `ansible.windows.win_command` is that `win_command` arguments will not be processed through the shell, so variables like `$env:HOME` and operations like `<`, `>`, `|`, and `;` will not work (use the `ansible.windows.win_shell` module if you need these features). The `ansible.windows.win_command` module is much more secure as itâ€™s not affected by the userâ€™s environment.

## End Result

Ad-hoc commands may be useful to run once in a while. However, as automation continues to grow within an environment, they are used less often.

!!! hint
    When a task is performed on a Windows server, Ansible is smart enough to know whether a reboot is required after executing that task. The below is part of the output of the command to remove the IIS feature. The output of this task can be used in subsequent tasks, like whether or not to reboot before continuing.
